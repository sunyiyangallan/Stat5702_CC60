### <a name="Start"></a> Get Started
For vscode users, one of the easiest ways to launch a local server is via the "[Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)" extension. Launch the server by simply click the "Go Live" button.

Another approach is through `http-server`, you can follow the instruction on [this site](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) to install the `http-server` via `npm`. You can launch the local server by the following command.
```bash
$ http-server [path]
```

### <a name="PiazzaActi"></a> Piazza Activities
We have been active on Piazza:
- 2019/9/9: notes on installing devtools and ucidata
- He talked about how he solved some bug regarding installing packages, and how to update R version. 

We also answered a few questions regarding midterm:
- Function of ungroup (If we don't use ungroup after we group some column, what will be happened? )
- Practice question Q15 (Why is the best strategy to draw a separate line for each of the 12 months? Why not facet on year or plot the monthly average?)

We also asked a few questions that evoked people's discussion for example:
Midterm practice question
- For number 16, why there is no association between race and day
- For number 30, why choose A instead of C

The professor also endorsed the answers
