2019/9/9: notes on installing devtools and ucidata
He talked about how he solved some bug regarding installing packages, and how to update R version. 

We also answered a few questions regarding midterm:
Function of ungroup (If we don't use ungroup after we group some column, what will be happened? )
practice question Q15 (Why is the best strategy to draw a separate line for each of the 12 months? Why not facet on year or plot the monthly average?)

We also asked a few questions that evoked people's discussion for example:
midterm practice question
For number 16, why there is no association between race and day
For number 30, why choose A instead of C

the professor also endorsed the answers


We also created a cheat sheet and some some problems for people who are new to d3 and html to look at.
